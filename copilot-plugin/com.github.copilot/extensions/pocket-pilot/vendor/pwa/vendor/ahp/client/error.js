/**
 * Error taxonomy for {@link AhpClient}.
 *
 * Five error families surface to consumers:
 *
 * - {@link TransportError} — failures of the underlying {@link AhpTransport}
 *   (closed connection, I/O, undecodable frames).
 * - {@link RpcError} — a JSON-RPC error response from the server.
 * - {@link RpcTimeoutError} — a client-side timeout firing before the
 *   server responded. Distinct from {@link RpcError}: there was no server
 *   error, the wait just elapsed.
 * - {@link ClientClosedError} — the client was shut down (or the transport
 *   was torn down) while a request was in flight.
 * - {@link AhpClientError} — base class; consumers can use `instanceof` to
 *   catch every error this SDK throws.
 *
 * Malformed inbound frames do not throw — they are logged via
 * `console.warn` and the channel stays alive (matching the Rust client's
 * `tracing::warn!` behavior). Pending requests still time out via
 * {@link RpcTimeoutError} if the bad frame would have been their reply.
 *
